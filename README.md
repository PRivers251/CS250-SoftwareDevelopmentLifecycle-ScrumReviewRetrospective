# CS250-SoftwareDevelopmentLifecycle-ScrumReviewRetrospective

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   I have now learned to interpret user needs through the use of user interviews and developing user stories. Before now all
   of the programs that I have written have either been for my own personal use or for a class assignment. Learning the idea
   of user stories helps me to now think in terms of developing applications that can be useful for others, not just myself.
   User stories force me to think in terms of user centrality. 
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   Before CS250, I really took a haphazard approach to planning scripts or programs that I wanted to work on. I usually just
   started with a vague idea of what I wanted the code to do and just started writing by trial and error. I now have some frameworks
   that I know will serve me moving forward. When it comes to the things that I want to focus on implementing now I will include techniques
   such as planning an MVP minimum viable product and using a more iterative approach when adding new features or making updates. The other
   technique that really struck me through this class is test-driven development because it forces me to really think through exactly
   what I want your code to do before I just start hacking away at it.
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   To be a good team member, I believe that it takes being very transparent. Communication is key. Honesty no matter the cost should always be
   the norm.
